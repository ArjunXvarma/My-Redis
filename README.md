# My-Redis
A lightweight, high-performance Redis clone built from scratch in C++. This project reimplements core Redis features—including an in-memory key-value store, basic data types, and a RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) parser—while exploring systems-level programming concepts such as sockets, event loops, and persistence.
